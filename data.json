    "text": "Your kitchen contains a host of energy-using appliances and there are ways to reduce their energy use. First, buy the most efficient units possible. This includes refrigerators, dishwashers, and stoves. (There isn’t much difference in microwave oven efficiency.)  Identifying the most efficient models is simple: just look for the EnergyStar label. This assures you that it’s among the top efficient models. For refrigerators avoid the automatic ice maker and drink dispenser because they cause more breakdowns and leaks, in addition to increasing energy use.  Can you consolidate one refrigerator for two that you already have?  A second refrigerator freezer, especially an older one, greatly increases your energy costs. Selecting the most efficient stove is also important.  Induction stoves are now the most efficient and provide features not available with traditional electric or gas stoves.  Induction stoves are still more expensive but the energy savings can repay the extra cost (especially if you cook at lot).",

    "text": "We often underestimate the amount of energy consumption that takes place in our bedrooms. That plugged in charger, the TV left on through the night and the thermostat turned right up, could all have a significant impact on your energy bills. Your bedroom is the place where you feel most at ease, which is why we tend to be slightly more frivolous with our energy usage. However, there are ways in which you can lower your energy consumption in your bedroom without compromising your comfort. LED and CFL lightbulbs are energy-efficient alternatives to traditional lights. They’re notoriously long-lasting and can help to lower your energy bills by using less energy to provide your bedroom with light. Replacing all lightbulbs in your home with LEDs could help you save approximately £40 a year. Many of us are guilty of leaving our phones, laptops and tablets charging through the night so that they have a full battery in the morning. However, this can consume a substantial amount of energy, especially since these devices do not need to be charged throughout the night. Switch your chargers off at the plug to save energy.",

Due to this, we tend to use a lot of energy in this area and this can have a huge impact on our energy bills. For the majority of people, electricity and gas bills are at their highest during wintertime. Although tempting, this can result in high energy bills. Fortunately, there are lots of ways in which you can reduce the energy you need to heat your home. Of course, you’ll need to turn on the heating sometimes. But you could reduce your energy consumption by only turning on the radiator in the living room when you are using it, if this is possible in your home. Making sure your lighting is energy-efficient is another great way to save energy in your living room. Check that your lightbulbs are energy saving, with low watt usage. If you are investing in new lighting, remember that LED lighting is the most energy-efficient. Replacing all your lightbulbs with LED lights could help save you up to £40 a year on your energy bills.",

But did you know that our water use at home contributes to our energy bills and our household carbon emissions Saving water can not only reduce your water bill (if you’re on a water meter), but it can also reduce your energy bills and your impact on the environment. Read on for our top tips to help you save in the bathroom. Use warm or cold water. Water heating accounts for 18% of a home’s energy consumption. Showering or washing your hands in warm or cool water, especially during hot weather, helps with summer energy conservation. Showering with hot water in the summer also adds unwanted heat to your home, making it difficult to maintain a comfortable interior temperature.",
